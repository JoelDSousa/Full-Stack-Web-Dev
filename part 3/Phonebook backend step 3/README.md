# Get specific person

Implement the functionality for displaying the information for a single phonebook entry. The url for getting the data for a person with the id 5 should be http://localhost:3001/api/persons/5

If an entry for the given id is not found, the server has to respond with the appropriate status code.

### Note: This was already implemented in the previous exercises
